               Sejnowski, Terrence",
  abstract  = "Neuronal synchronization can be defined as a correlated
               appearance in time of two or more events associated with various
               aspects of neuronal activity. Neuronal synchronization depends
               on chemical and electrical synaptic as well as ephaptic and
               non-specific interactions. We consider two distinct types of
               neuronal synchronization: local synchronization that is
               responsible for the generation of local field potentials; and
               long-range synchronization, detected with distantly located
               electrodes and mediated primarily via chemical synaptic
               interactions, which contributes to the EEG synchronization.
               Neocortical synchronization during sleep and wakefulness is
               often associated with rhythmic oscillations of neuronal
               activity: slow oscillation, delta, spindle, beta, gamma and
               ripples. Normal thalamocortical oscillations [sleep or wake
               oscillations] are generated as a result of both local and
               long-range synchronization. During paroxysmal [seizure]
               activity, the role of chemical synaptic interactions decreases
               because of alterations in ionic composition that impairs
               synaptic transmission. Synchronized activities in large
               population of neurons (such as neocortex) may occur as nearly
               simultaneous patterns across an entire population or as
               propagating waves. Neocortical synchronization is controlled by
               the activities in ascending systems: cholinergic,
               norepinephrinergic and serotoninergic. The presence of
               cortico-thalamo-cortical feedback loops contribute to the
               synchronization of cortical activities. We propose that all the
               types of neuronal interactions contribute to the generation of
               synchronous oscillatory activities, but the ratio of their
               contribution is different for different types of oscillations.",
